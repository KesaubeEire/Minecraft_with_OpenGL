#MineCraft_OpenGL
- Pay tribute to [MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge](https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge)
For long time I did't find a very proper project to combine Cpp Learning with OpenGL Learning.  
So at the time I find the 7-days making video on Youtube I get it very excited.  
It's absolutely a childish project, wish I can complete it.
